To get the flag you need to like all moments, but you can't to this manually.

Cookie data is encoded in base64 and has the following content:
{"1":false,"2":false,"3":false,"4":false,"5":false,"6":false,"7":false,"8":false,"9":false,"10":false}

You only need to change "false" to "true", encode in base64 and set the data cookie with this new value.
